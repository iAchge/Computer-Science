## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** disclose it publicly.  
Instead, contact me directly:

- **Email:** ghostachge@proton.me  
- **GitHub Security Advisory:**  
  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/security/advisories/new

(Replace `USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY` with your actual GitHub information.)

Please do **not** open a public issue containing vulnerability details.

## Responsible Disclosure Process

When you report a vulnerability:

1. We will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**.
2. We will review and assess the issue as soon as possible.
3. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix or mitigation.
4. We will coordinate with you on a responsible disclosure timeline.
5. Once a fix is released, we will publish a short summary in the release notes or a security advisory.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- All code and resources contained in this repository  
- Official releases produced for this alarm system project  

Out of scope:

## Safe Harbor

If you make a good-faith effort to follow this policy when conducting security research, we will consider your actions to fall under “safe harbor.”  
We will not pursue legal action or reporting against researchers who:

- Report vulnerabilities responsibly  
- Avoid privacy violations  
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate its existence  
- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure  

We appreciate ethical research and responsible disclosure practices.
